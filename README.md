# Classic-Alien-Games
I followed along someone's code to make this as practise. Attempts to replicate the classic arcade alien invader game.
the code is simple, only things missing from repo is the bg music, but, i dont know how to upload a file of that size as yet since its a long song. other than that, every other
asset i used has been uploaded.
